## 🧠 Smart Fill Logic

The extension intelligently handles different scenarios:

- **Saved 6, Page has 3**: Fills first 3 pilgrims
- **Saved 3, Page has 6**: Fills first 3 pilgrims (leaves rest empty)
- **Saved 4, Page has 6**: Fills first 4 pilgrims
- **Empty slots**: Automatically skipped

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Extension doesn't appear
- Ensure Developer Mode is enabled
- Try reloading the extension
- Check for any errors in Edge Extensions page

### Auto-Fill button doesn't work
- Make sure you're on the correct page: `ttdevasthanams.ap.gov.in/spat/pilgrim-details`
- Verify you've saved pilgrim data first
- Refresh the booking page and try again

### Fields not filling correctly
- Check if the website structure has changed
- Open Developer Console (F12) and check for error messages
- Try filling one pilgrim manually first to ensure form is active

### Dropdowns not selecting
- The extension uses a 10-15ms delay for dropdown interactions
- If network is slow, try refreshing and filling again
- Make sure you're using exact values: "Aadhaar Card" or "Passport"
